	<h3>Why Limelight Health?</h3>
	
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">
		<dt>lime·light – noun</dt>

		<dd>The center of attention: “In the limelight” or spotlight.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>Your clients don’t need to know our name and brand. That’s why we’ve created tools and technology to promote your name and brand. Limelight products are “private-labeled” which means you can make them yours.</p>
	
	<p>We put the agent in the ‘limelight’ and help promote your agency.</p>
